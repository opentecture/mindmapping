It is a living lab for interdisciplinary experimentation, a platform that will be the main feature of Matera 2019 cultural programme. Its main goal is to produce the infrastructure necessary for Matera 2019. The Open Design School is not a school. It will serve as an instrument of systemic, community-wide capacity building where learning occurs through doing, prototyping and testing, in a continuous creative exchange process between art, science, and technology. It is a horizontal platform, a place of interdisciplinary learning and experimentation without strict hierarchies in which everyone learns from everyone, in an atmosphere of mutual enrichment."}

Here, 'architecture' is used in the sense of computer architecture -- it refers not to the design of buildings, but to how the components of a complex system interact. Information exchange includes the movement of people and goods, personal contact and interactions, telecommunications, as well as visual input from the environment. Information networks provide a basis for understanding living cities and for diagnosing urban problems. This paper argues that a city works less like an electronic computer, and more like the human brain. As a functionally complex system, it heuristically defines its own functionality by changing connections so as to optimize how components interact. An effective city will be one with a system architecture that can respond to changing conditions. This analysis shifts the focus of understanding cities from their physical structure to the flow of information."}

What you see is the actual model (check out the 3D view). These LEGO components are the building blocks for building blocks. Too many large LEGO models are unable to fit in the warehouse, because of large file size (over 10MB). Now with blocks broken down into micro-components, you can fit double, quadruple or better the number of LEGOs, for larger sets, bigger models and more play-time. I doubt that there is a LEGO set which would not fit in the warehouse, using these pieces. These very accurate blocks have detailed undersides, simplified geometries and even the logos in the appropriate places. It is difficult to believe that they use less file space, I know! More unique pieces coming soon, for infinite possibilities. You can see an example model (6 wheeled crane from Technic designers idea book #8891) that I have begun to assemble and color. (Still at 10x or 10:1 scale) Please leave a rating if you are wowed by how small the file size is."}
